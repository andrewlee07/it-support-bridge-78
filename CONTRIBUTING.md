## Commit messages and pull requests

- Use clear commit messages describing what you changed.
- Open a pull request against the `main` branch with a summary of your changes.

## Coding standards

- The project uses TypeScript, React and Tailwind CSS.
- All new components and utilities should include unit tests with Vitest and React Testing Library.
- Keep code linting errors to zero by running `npm run lint` before committing.

For major features or bug fixes, consider opening an issue first to discuss your proposal.
